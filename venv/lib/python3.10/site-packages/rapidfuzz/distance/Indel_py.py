    Calculates the minimum number of insertions and deletions
    required to change one sequence into the other. This is equivalent to the
    Levenshtein distance with a substitution weight of 2.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s1 : Sequence[Hashable]
        First string to compare.
    s2 : Sequence[Hashable]
        Second string to compare.
    processor: callable, optional
        Optional callable that is used to preprocess the strings before
        comparing them. Default is None, which deactivates this behaviour.
    score_cutoff : int, optional
        Maximum distance between s1 and s2, that is
        considered as a result. If the distance is bigger than score_cutoff,
        score_cutoff + 1 is returned instead. Default is None, which deactivates

    Returns
    -------
    distance : int

    --------
