## What is this?

**Open Interpreter** provides a minimal, [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) chat interface to GPT-4 in your terminal, which can run Python code and reflect on its output.

This extends GPT-4 with Python's general-purpose capabilities:

- Create and edit photos, videos, PDFs, etc.
- Run `selenium` to control a Chrome browser.
- Sequence DNA with `biopython`.
- ...etc.

## Demo Notebook

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WKmRXZgsErej2xUriKzxrEAXdxMSgWbb?usp=sharing)

## Features

- Generated code runs locally.
- Uses `pip` and `apt-get` to extend itself.
- Interactive, streaming chat inside your terminal.

## Quick Start

```shell
pip install open-interpreter
```

### Python

```python
import interpreter

interpreter.api_key = "<openai_api_key>"
interpreter.chat() # Starts an interactive chat
```

### Terminal

After installation, set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, then simply run `interpreter`:

```shell
interpreter
```

## Use Cases

Open Interpreter acts as a junior programmer that can execute code snippets to accomplish tasks.

1. Add subtitles to all videos in a folder.
2. Blur all faces in a photo or video.
4. Edit a large batch of documents.

## Comparison to ChatGPT's Code Interpreter

OpenAI's recent release of [Code Interpreter](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins#code-interpreter) with GPT-4 presents a fantastic opportunity to accomplish real-world tasks with ChatGPT.

However, OpenAI's service is hosted, closed-source, and heavily restricted:
- No internet access.
- [Limited set  of pre-installed packages](https://wfhbrian.com/mastering-chatgpts-code-interpreter-list-of-python-packages/).
- 100 MB maximum upload, 120.0 second runtime limit.
- State is cleared (along with any generated files or links) when the environment dies.

---

Open Interpreter overcomes these limitations by running in a stateful Jupyter notebook on your local environment. It has full access to the internet, isn't restricted by time or file size, and can utilize any package or library.

**Open Interpreter combines the power of GPT-4's Code Interpreter with the flexibility of your local development environment.**

## Commands

#### Interactive Chat

To start an interactive chat in your terminal, either run `interpreter` from the command line:

```shell
interpreter
```

Or `interpreter.chat()` from a .py file:

```python
interpreter.chat()
```

#### Programmatic Chat

For more precise control, you can pass messages directly to `.chat(message)`:

```python
interpreter.chat("Add subtitles to all videos in /videos.")

# ... Streams output to your terminal, completes task ...

interpreter.chat("These look great but can you make the subtitles bigger?")

# ...
```

#### Start a New Chat

In Python, Open Interpreter remembers conversation history. If you want to start fresh, you can reset it:

```python
interpreter.reset()
```

#### Save and Restore Chats

`interpreter.chat()` returns a List of messages, which can be restored with `interpreter.load(messages)`:

```python
messages = interpreter.chat() # Save chat to 'messages'
interpreter.reset() # Reset interpreter

interpreter.load(messages) # Resume chat from 'messages'
```

#### Customize System Message

You can inspect and configure Open Interpreter's system message to extend its functionality, modify permissions, or give it more context.

```python
interpreter.system_message += """
Run shell commands with -y so the user doesn't have to confirm them.
"""
print(interpreter.system_message)
```

## How Does it Work?

Open Interpreter equips a [function-calling GPT-4](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling) with the `exec()` function.

We then stream the model's messages, code, and your system's outputs to the terminal as Markdown.

Only the last `model_max_tokens` of the conversation are shown to the model, so conversations can be any length, but older messages may be forgotten.
