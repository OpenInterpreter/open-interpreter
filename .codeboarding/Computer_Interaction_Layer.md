## Component Details



The Computer Interaction Layer is a critical subsystem within the project, designed to provide the Interpreter Core with a unified and high-level programmatic interface for interacting with the underlying computer system. It achieves this by aggregating and managing various specialized computer tools, thereby abstracting the complexities of direct system interaction. This design is fundamental as it isolates the core logic of the interpreter from the specifics of operating system interactions, enhancing portability, maintainability, and extensibility.



### Computer Interaction Layer

The primary component that acts as a central hub, providing a unified, high-level programmatic interface for the Interpreter Core to interact with the underlying computer system. It aggregates and manages various specialized computer tools, abstracting the complexities of direct system interaction (e.g., file system, browser, display, AI capabilities).
