title: Profiles
---

Profiles are a powerful way to customize your instance of Open Interpreter.

Profiles are Python files that configure Open Interpreter. A wide range of fields from the [model](/settings/all-settings#model-selection) to the [context window](/settings/all-settings#context-window) to the [message templates](/settings/all-settings#user-message-template) can be configured in a Profile. This allows you to save multiple variations of Open Interpreter to optimize for your specific use-cases.

You can access your Profiles by running `interpreter --profiles`. This will open the directory where all of your Profiles are stored.

To apply a Profile to an Open Interpreter session, you can run `interpreter --profile <name>`. This must follow a specific schema, better to inspect the examples below. I would suggest the YAML configuration, so I will address it first.

# Example Profiles

For example, if you take a look at "All settings," you will see that each setting has three tabs: Terminal, Python, and Profile. All these tabs expect different inputs for the same configuration. 

## Profile (YAML)

First, we want to know where the interpreter stores the profiles on the current machine. For this, we use the command:

```shell
interpreter --profiles
```
On macOS, this will open a new Finder window where (after your initial setup), you will see a single configuration named `default.yaml`. Now, let's duplicate this file and name it, for example, deepseek.yaml. 

```shell
ls -al ~/Library/Application\ Support/open-interpreter/profiles
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  4 justme  staff   128 Jun 20 19:38 .
drwxr-xr-x  5 justme  staff   160 Jun 20 19:36 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 justme  staff  1280 Jun 20 20:06 deepseek.yaml
-rw-r--r--  1 justme  staff  1280 Jun 20 19:42 default.yaml
```
Now, let's edit this file `deepseek.yaml` to our liking :)

```shell
# LLM Settings
llm:
  model: "deepseek-coder"
  temperature: 0
  api_key: "sk-..." # Your API key, if the API requires it
  api_base: "https://api.deepseek.com/v1" # The URL where an OpenAI-compatible server is running to handle LLM API requests
  max_output: 2500 # The maximum characters of code output visible to the LLM

# Computer Settings
computer:
  import_computer_api: True # Gives OI a helpful Computer API designed for code interpreting language models
  verbose: True
  emit_images: True

# Custom Instructions
# custom_instructions: "After starting do crie for help" # This will be appended to the system message

# General Configuration
auto_run: True # If True, code will run without asking for confirmation
safe_mode: "ask" # The safety mode for the LLM — one of "off", "ask", "auto"
multi_line: True # If True, you can input multiple lines starting and ending with ```

# Documentation
# All options: https://docs.openinterpreter.com/settings

version: 0.2.5 # Profile version (do not modify)
```

At this point you should be able to run your new profile configuration, via:

```shell
interpreter --profile deepseek.yaml
```

Now you can torture deepseeker :)

## Terminal

If you want to start a slightly more complex configuration via the terminal, you won't want to enter it every time. Instead, create an alias in your shell configuration, such as in a Z-Shell (~/.zshrc):

```shell
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-......
alias deepseek='conda activate deepseek-env && \
interpreter --api_base "https://api.deepseek.com/v1" --api_key "$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY" \
--model "deepseek-coder" --context_window 128000 -y -ml'
```
We have assumed that Python environment management is handled with Conda. You can read more about it here: [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

Conda is not required, of course. You could also start the Open-Interpreter directly in the terminal (see the All Settings section for the keys used), with a slight modification since we want to read the api_key from the environment variable. (So it makes sense to set the key as an environment variable first):

```shell
# Set the environment variable and add it to .zshrc (e.g. Z-Shell on MacOS)
echo 'export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="sk-......"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
Re-load Z-Shell:

```shell
zsh -l
```

Then start open-interpreter

```shell
interpreter --api_base "https://api.deepseek.com/v1" --api_key "$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY" \
--model "deepseek-coder" --context_window 128000 -y -ml
```

## Python

```Python
from interpreter import interpreter

interpreter.os = True
interpreter.llm.supports_vision = True

interpreter.llm.model = "gpt-4-vision-preview"

interpreter.llm.supports_functions = False
interpreter.llm.context_window = 110000
interpreter.llm.max_tokens = 4096
interpreter.auto_run = True
interpreter.loop = True
```

<Tip>
  There are many settings that can be configured. [See them all
  here](/settings/all-settings)

## Helpful settings for local models

Local models benefit from more coercion and guidance. This verbosity of adding extra context to messages can impact the conversational experience of Open Interpreter. The following settings allow templates to be applied to messages to improve the steering of the language model while maintaining the natural flow of conversation.

`interpreter.user_message_template` allows users to have their message wrapped in a template. This can be helpful steering a language model to a desired behaviour without needing the user to add extra context to their message.

`interpreter.always_apply_user_message_template` has all user messages to be wrapped in the template. If False, only the last User message will be wrapped.

`interpreter.code_output_template` wraps the output from the computer after code is run. This can help with nudging the language model to continue working or to explain outputs.

`interpreter.empty_code_output_template` is the message that is sent to the language model if code execution results in no output.
