title: LMC Messages

To support the incoming `L`anguage `M`odel `C`omputer architecture, we extend OpenAI's messages format to include additional information, and a new role called `computer`.

## Roles

Role|Description|

`user`|The individual interacting with the system.|
`assistant`|The language model.|
`computer`|The system that executes the language model's commands.|

## Possible Message Types / Formats
