### Interactive Chat

To start an interactive chat in your terminal, either run `interpreter` from the command line:

```shell
interpreter
```

Or `interpreter.chat()` from a .py file:

```python
interpreter.chat()
```

---

### Programmatic Chat

For more precise control, you can pass messages directly to `.chat(message)` in Python:

```python
interpreter.chat("Add subtitles to all videos in /videos.")

# ... Displays output in your terminal, completes task ...

interpreter.chat("These look great but can you make the subtitles bigger?")

# ...
```

---

### Start a New Chat

In your terminal, Open Interpreter behaves like ChatGPT and will not remember previous conversations. Simply run `interpreter` to start a new chat:

```shell
interpreter
```

In Python, Open Interpreter remembers conversation history. If you want to start fresh, you can reset it:

```python
interpreter.reset()
```

---

### Save and Restore Chats

In your terminal, Open Interpreter will save previous conversations to `<your application directory>/Open Interpreter/conversations/`.

You can resume any of them by running `--conversations`. Use your arrow keys to select one , then press `ENTER` to resume it.

```shell
interpreter --conversations
```

In Python, `interpreter.chat()` returns a List of messages, which can be used to resume a conversation with `interpreter.messages = messages`:

```python
# Save messages to 'messages'
messages = interpreter.chat("My name is Killian.")

# Reset interpreter ("Killian" will be forgotten)
interpreter.reset()

# Resume chat from 'messages' ("Killian" will be remembered)
interpreter.messages = messages
```

### Configure Default Settings

We save default settings to a configuration file which can be edited by running the following command:

```shell
interpreter --config
```

You can use this to set your default language model, system message (custom instructions), max budget, etc.

<Info>**Note:** The Python library will also inherit settings from this config file, but you can only change it by running `interpreter --config` or navigating to `<your application directory>/Open Interpreter/config.yaml` and editing it manually.</Info>

---

### Customize System Message

In your terminal, modify the system message by [editing your configuration file as described here](#configure-default-settings).

In Python, you can inspect and configure Open Interpreter's system message to extend its functionality, modify permissions, or give it more context.

```python
interpreter.system_message += """
Run shell commands with -y so the user doesn't have to confirm them.
"""
print(interpreter.system_message)
```

---

### Change your Language Model

Open Interpreter uses [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/) to connect to language models.

You can change the model by setting the model parameter:

```shell
interpreter --model gpt-3.5-turbo
interpreter --model claude-2
interpreter --model command-nightly
```

In Python, set the model on the object:

```python
interpreter.model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
```
